    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Animations** notebook! In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create animations using the **accessvis** package. Animations can bring your visualisations to life and help convey dynamic processes, such as changes over time or camera movements.\n",

    "This notebook covers the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **lv.Video()**: Understanding the arguments and basic usage to create video animations.\n",
    "- **Example 1**: Creating a simple spin and zoom animation to demonstrate camera movements.\n",
    "- **Example 2**: Visualising the maximum temperature from 2000 to 2014, with the Earth spinning while displaying the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you’ll be able to create basic animations and explore more complex visualisation scenarios.\n",

    "## lv.video() Arguments and Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a video in **accessvis**, the best approach is to use the `lv.video()` context manager. Below are the key arguments you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **filename**: Specifies the path and name of the video file to save.\n",
    "- **quality**: Controls the quality of the video, with options ranging from 1 (low) to 3 (high), higher quality means less compression artifacts but a larger file\n",
    "- **resolution**: Sets the resolution of the saved video.\n",
    "- **framerate=30**: Defines the frames per second (FPS) for the video.\n",
    "- **params=\"autoplay\"**: If included, the video will be displayed within the notebook upon completion.\n",
    "- **width/height**: Defines the dimensions of the video player in the Jupyter notebook. This can be useful if the video player is too large for your screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a frame for the video, call `lv.render()` within the context manager. By adjusting parameters between each `lv.render()` call, your animation will be saved as a video.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes for users working in Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "- The default save path may not match the folder where your notebook is located. It's best to specify a full path for the filename.\n",
    "- On NCI Gadi, the default folder is typically `~/` (your home directory), which might differ from your notebook's location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s look at some examples to see how this works in action!"

    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined our starting and ending points, let's create the video. We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `lv.video()` context manager to start recording the animation.\n",
    "2. Iterate through the latitude, longitude, and zoom values over the course of the animation.\n",
    "3. Update the camera view at each step.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will use `tqdm` to display a progress bar during the iteration, though this is optional.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Context Manager**: `lv.video()` begins the process of recording the animation to a video file (`spin_and_zoom.mp4`).\n",
    "- **Camera Movement**: The camera is moved by interpolating between the start and end positions for both latitude and longitude, as well as zoom level.\n",
    "- **Progress Bar**: `tqdm` provides a progress bar to track the animation's progress (optional).\n",
    "- **Render**: `lv.render()` captures each frame of the animation.\n",
    "- **Pause**: A brief pause (`time.sleep(1)`) is added at the end to hold the last frame for a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the video file will be saved in the working directory, which may not be the same as the notebook’s location. You may want to specify an absolute path for saving if necessary."
